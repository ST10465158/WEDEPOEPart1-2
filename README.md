WEDEPOE part 2

I completed my part 1 of the POE on my local machine, and that was not successful as pushing to github was not easy and did not work anyway. I tried to push my first commit into this repository created and last updated 27th of August: https://github.com/ST10465158/WEDEPOEPart1 

here is proof of the date:

and here is what is looks like in that repository, nothing there, as my pushing to github was unsuccessful:

And to push my initial commit to github, I watched my lecturers video on "How to submit part 1 of POE" and everything worked until the final command of " git push -u origin main". I dont understand why, I followed all the steps correctly. Below is a screenshot of the steps I had to follow to push and commit my code:

so I am going to insert the screenshots of my code to show that i indeed did the work for my part 1.

Here is the document that was required as well for the POE: [Web Development Part 1 ST10465158.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22582873/Web.Development.Part.1.ST10465158.docx)


Before I show the code here are all my screenshots for the folder structure I had created below:

In my word document for the part 1 for my POE, i also included screenshits of the code there as shown below:

Here are the screenshots of the same code that i did using my local machine, that coressponds to each of the webpages that i have also screenshotted to show that the code worked:

Now, here below is a screenshot again showing my code using my local machine, please look at the TOP RIGHT, those blue icons show that i did attempt to push my code and commit:

PART 2:

So for my part 2 of my POE im also re-doing the steps for my part 1 using the cloudlabs virtual machine because I am now using the virtual machine for the rest of my POE. I CREATED A NEW REPOSITORY FOR THIS which is the one you are seeing right now:  (so that my old repository would't affect anything here).

so I went into my virtual machine (on 27th September 2025) and made a new folder calling it "WebsitePart1&2ofPOE". (Below is a screenshot to show:)
<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-27 at 11 34 08" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/541c81fd-5bae-41b9-bfe9-6cf5618edb1a" />

I then went back to my local machine's visual studio code, and copied and pasted my code from there to my virtual machine so that everthing would be the same as my part 1 (below is a screenshit showing my copying process:)
<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-27 at 12 06 11" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b6c222f1-9495-486e-9b5c-80519bf5e2a4" />

After I pasted all my code to my virtaul machine, i attempted, AGAIN, through my virtual machine this time, to upload my code to THIS repository:

and AGAIN after following the steps, it did not work. I followed the steps to the T. Everything worked until the last step. I do not understand why. (here is that screenshot below:)

<img width="1440" height="900" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-27 at 12 51 41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0172d20b-1829-49fd-86ba-9f3261c660f3" />

So since i cannot at this point, update my commit pushes that way, I WILL BE UPDATING THE CHANGES THAT I MADE TO MY CODE OVER HERE IN THIS README FILE.

Here is what I have so far:

1. Here below is my folder structure again:

   I also made an image folder which is empty so far, as seen below:
